Goat & Lamb Breeding Program — Community-focused, sustainable model

---

## Executive Summary

- Launch a breeding program starting with 10 goats and 15 sheep.
- Scale to a sustainable herd of ~50 animals through managed breeding.
- Direct-to-consumer sales, community-investor model, and value-added processing.

---

## Market Overview & Pain Points

- Domestic production lags demand; heavy reliance on imports (Australia, NZ).
- Pain points:
  - Limited availability of fresh, local goat/lamb
  - Lack of transparency in origin and processing
  - Price inefficiency from long supply chains
  - Barriers for niche markets (Halal/Zabiha)

---

## The Opportunity

1. Serve unmet ethnic & gourmet demand willing to pay premium.
2. Capture the local-food movement: sustainability, welfare, community.
3. Build a resilient D2C model insulated from commodity volatility.
4. Offer local investment opportunities to the community.

---

## Our Solution

- Community-Centric Breeding Program: investors are customers.
- Direct-to-Consumer Sales: remove intermediaries, improve margins.
- Value-Added Processing: on-site facility, custom cuts, Halal compliance.

---

## Competitive Landscape

- Large Commercial Producers: scale & low cost, but frozen/opaque supply.
- Local Small Farms: local appeal but may lack processing & consistency.
- Imported Meat: available but frozen, long transit, untraceable origin.

How we compete: freshness, traceability, ethical practices, community brand.

## SWOT Analysis

Strengths
- High-value niche product; hardiness of small ruminants; multiple revenue streams.

Weaknesses
