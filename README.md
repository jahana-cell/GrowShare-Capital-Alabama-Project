# Artisan Meats Collective — Presentation

This is a simple static web presentation generated from the provided Goat & Lamb Breeding Program business plan. It is intended for local preview and quick sharing.

Files created:
- `index.html` — The presentation slides and structure.
- `styles.css` — Styling and responsive layout.
- `script.js` — Slide navigation, keyboard and touch support.

New features:
- Speaker notes per slide (toggle using the Notes button)
- Fullscreen toggle for presentation mode
- Professional header with logo and improved typography
- Print-friendly styles for handouts

How to run locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser. No server required.
2. Use the Prev/Next buttons, arrow keys, or swipe on mobile to navigate.

GitHub Pages note:
 - This is a static site and works fine on GitHub Pages. Push to a repository and enable Pages in the settings; `index.html` at the repo root will serve as the landing page.

Next steps / enhancements:
- Add images and branding (logo, photos of the farm)
- Export as PDF for handouts
- Integrate with a small CMS or markdown-to-slide generator
