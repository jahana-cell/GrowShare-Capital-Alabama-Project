# Artisan Meats Collective — Presentation

This is a simple static web presentation generated from the provided Goat & Lamb Breeding Program business plan. It is intended for local preview and quick sharing.

Files created:
- `index.html` — The presentation slides and structure.
- `styles.css` — Styling and responsive layout.
- `script.js` — Slide navigation, keyboard and touch support.

Features:
- Fullscreen toggle for presentation mode
- Professional header with logo and improved typography
- Colorful single-page scroll presentation with interactive components

How to navigate:
- Use the left side navigation to jump to sections.
- Use the Prev/Next buttons or Arrow keys / PageUp-PageDown to move between panels.
- On mobile, swipe up/down to move between panels.

How to run locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser. No server required.
2. Use the Prev/Next buttons, arrow keys, or swipe on mobile to navigate.

GitHub Pages note:
 - This is a static site and works fine on GitHub Pages. Push to a repository and enable Pages in the settings; `index.html` at the repo root will serve as the landing page.

Next steps / enhancements:
- Add more images and branding (upload your logo/photos and I’ll wire them in)
- Export as PDF for handouts
- Convert to reveal.js or other slide frameworks if you want speaker view and export
